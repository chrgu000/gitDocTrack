错误信息（安装libexpat1-dev时，报错如下）：
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 wps-office:i386 : Depends: libc6:i386 (>= 2.12) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libstdc++6:i386 (>= 4.5) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libfreetype6:i386 (>= 2.4) but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libglu1-mesa:i386 but it is not going to be installed
                   Depends: libcups2:i386 but it is not going to be installed
                   Recommends: ttf-mscorefonts-installer:i386
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

出现原因：
上次安装wps-offices未安装成功，本次安装libexpat1-dev会出现上次未解决问题的信息。
